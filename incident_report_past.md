FIXED

Due to Ethswitch migration, other bank transfer for a few banks will not work.<br />
The service interruptions are expected from **November 29, 2024, at 5:00 AM** until **December 2, 2024, at 5:00 AM**.

06/11/2024 04:10 PM EAT We are unable to reach the national switch to make bank transfers. This will cause all bank transfers to fail. We have identified the root-cause to be a failure on the network connectivity at EthSwitch side and have engaged with their support team to resolve this as soon as possible.

09/11/2024 10:00 AM EAT Still working with EthSwitch on resolution. We are enabling direct bank integrations to unblock transfer to few banks, while in parallel we figure out a full solution.

09/11/2024 2:35 PM EAT EthSwitch has resolved the issue, and we are able to make bank transfers again.
